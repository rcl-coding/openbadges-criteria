# Coding Skills Foundation Open Badges Criteria

## The objective of the Coding Skills Foundation is to facilitate the recognition of achievement of coding skills achieved by persons outside the formal education and training system.

### View Available Criteria

### Introduction 

We hope to foster a truly open system where badge issuers, learners and employers create an environment of mutual trust for recognition of coding skills.

To this end, we have adopted the [Open Badges V2.0 Specification](https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html) published by the [ IMS Global Learning Consortium](https://www.imsglobal.org/)  for the mutual recognition of coding skills.

### Criteria for OpenBadges

The criteria for obtaining an open badge lists the knowledge , skills and requirements that a learner must demonstrate to be awarded the badge.

### Structure of Criteria
